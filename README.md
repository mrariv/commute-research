# Commute and Well-being Relationship
A project that involved data collection, preprocessing and further analysis to determine how commute features are related with well-being indicators. The project was completed as my first ever research.

## Data Collection
Data was collected using webiste parsing (Selenium) and automation (PyAutoGUI) due to its unavailability. The chosen sample of students and their e-mail addresses were then used to send out question survey.

## Data Preparation
For analysis data was prepared by ordinally encoding all key variables and one-hot encoding of categorical variables.

## Data Analysis
After collecting data it was analyzed by using regression tools, primarily linear regression with heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors. The analysis also includes visual demonstration of distributions.

Correlation analysis was also used to find potential relations between variables.

## Results
Resutls showcased that usage of train during commute is moderately correlated with commute time. It also showed that students of the furthest from the center college building show a moderate negative correlation with metro usage, meaning students of HSE MIEM faculty are less likely to use metro in their daily commute route.
Overall, students showed an average of 60 minutes of commute time which is significantly greater than in other major urban areas.
