# Commute and Well-Being Relationship
This was my first independent research project, focused on understanding how commute characteristic relate to students' well-being.

## Data Collection
Data was obtained through webiste parsing (using Selenium) and automation tools (PyAutoGUI), due to its limited public availability. The chosen sample of students was identified, and e-mail addresses were used to distribute a survey with well-being and commute-related questions.

## Data Preparation
Key variables were ordinally encoded, and categorical variables were processed using one-hot encoding to prepare the dataset for analysis.

## Data Analysis
The analysis involved multiple regression models, primarily linear regression with heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors. Distribution visualizations and correlation analysis were used to explore variable relationships.

## Results
The results revealed a moderate correlation between train usage and commute time. Additionally, students from the HSE MIEM faculty — located furthest from the city center — were moderately less likely to use the metro. On average, students reported a daily commute time of 60 minutes, which is significantly longer than typical averages in other large urban areas.
